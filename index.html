            <p>
                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture 
                and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally. 
                The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
                who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
                Little Lemon is more than just a restaurant; it's a culinary journey infused with passion and authenticity.
                Whether you're seeking a romantic evening for two or a gathering with loved ones,
                we invite you to join us at Little Lemon. Let us transport you to the heart of Chicago,
                where every meal is a celebration of life, love, and the art of good food.

                Buon Appetito!

                        good, some italian classics and some twists, and for their prices it's 100% worth it.</p>
